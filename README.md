# Game of Life
Classical programming task which represents a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton.
The "game" is actually a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, needing no input from human players. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

## Implementation
This implementation was made with Java and have Swing GUI. 
User can generate random first generation or load one from text file (e.g., [this one](https://github.com/Hexronimo/game-of-life/blob/master/test1-77P4H1V01.txt
)). Also user may choose generation speed and cells color.
